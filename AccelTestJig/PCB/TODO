- 5V driving LEDs means that 3.3V GPIO pins can't shutoff LED completely when
  high.  Workaround: turn off LEDs by making pin an Input.
- FIXME: Button is wired wrong.  Cut GPIO trace and wire to diagonally opposite pin.
- Pass/fail LEDs would be MUCH better on bottom edge of board (easier to solder, easier to see
  when board is sitting level.
